# wsl-get

wsl-get is a tool which handles a collection of .deb packages that I (and contributors) use often when utilising WSL2. Rather than manually typing a wget command to download package files, use this little tool instead!

## Installation

This assumes that you are already running a debian-based WSL2 instance.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chadano/wsl-get
cd wsl-get/
python3 wsl-get.py
```
